    I have an absurd amount of animals, so I thought I would introduce you to them. The Matriach of the family is my 6 year old calico, Mamma Kitty. She goes by many names and responds to none of them. We are simply living in her world that she allows us to serve her in. Loves: herself, cuddles (only when she allows), dog beds, and catnip.
